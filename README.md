# Missing skroutz unit price elements
I created a Chrome extension that uses product titles to extract the size of unit of measurement of it.  
Skoutz.gr has already implemented `unit-price` elements for some product categories, so I skipped those pages from parsing.
Using this variable and the price of the product I extract its unit price and render it to the dom next to product price.
** This isn't a production ready implementation. **
